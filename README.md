# Genetic-Algorithm
**Thesis for my High school Degree in Computer Science made in academic year 2017/2018**

Simple implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to understand which phrase has been entered by the user and find it, with explanation. 

### In this repository you can find:
* **GeneticAlgorithm**: the JAVA project made with NetBeans (/src/ for .java files)
* **Genetic Algorithm.pdf**: *theory and explanation* of this typology of algorithms and of this project
* **GeneticAlgorithm/dist/GeneticAlgorithm.jar**: program already built, try it!


### Execution:
Customize settings and test the algorithm to find the input entered by the user with fitness, selection, inheritance and mutation functions.

Example of execution:
